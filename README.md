# Nerd of the Dance


Some dancers including myself would like to have some means to memorize dance steps. 
For me, a notation should be easy to understand, allow for describing the essential structure of a step and for some little extras
and it should be possible to associate the steps with the music. 

Below is an easy example of this attempt to meet these goals. The step is taken from Tango Argentino and is called base con cruce, a basic step with a cross.
