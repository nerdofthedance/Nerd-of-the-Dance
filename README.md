# Dance step notation in a music score


Some dancers including myself would like to have some means to memorize dance steps. 
For me, a notation should be easy to understand, allow for describing the essential structure of a step and for some little extras
and it should be possible to associate the steps with the music. 

Below is an easy example of a notation trying to meet these goals. The step is taken from Tango Argentino and is called base con cruce, a basic step with a cross.

# Requirements

The notation is based on Liypond. There is a lot of documentation, examples and templates, and a vivid and competent community. Download from http://lilypond.org and install as described there. Lilypond runs on Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, MAC OS X, and Windows. Editing is a lot easier if you also install Frescobaldi, an integrated development environment for Lilypond. Download from http://frescobaldi.org/ and install as described there. It also runs on Linux, MAC OS X and on Windows. 
Other than that there are no requirements.

On Ubuntu Linux (and probably on other Debian based Linux system, I didn't test this) installation is easy:
```
sudo apt-get install lilypond
sudo apt-get install frescobaldi
```

## Hello world
After installation, start frescobaldi, open the file Tango_Base_con_cruce.ly and press Ctrl+Shift+P (or click the lilypond icon). If everything is OK, you will see the above example to the right. 

# How to read the dance notation

The dance notation is somewhat analogous to the music notation. This means that it marks certain events in the dance, but in a discretized manner. It displays poses, i.e. positions and orientations of the four feet of the dance couple, the weight on the feet, and the association of the motion with the music.  

## Poses and motion

The diagram is like an image of the couple taken from above, showing only the feet. The feet of the leader are drawn with a 
corner, the feet of the follower look like walking sticks. See the initial diagram in bar 2 in the example above: theitio couple is standing face to face, the leader facing north, the follower facing south (the directions are like the ones of a usual map, north pointing to the top of the page, south to the bottom etc.). 

The leader has the weight on the right foot, the follower has the weight on the left foot. 
The weight on the foot corresponds to the thickness of the line.

Currently there are two weights, one (thick line) for the foot you are firmly standing on and one (thin line) for the foot that is ready to move.

There is a discrete number of positions for a foot in the diagram. Currently there are 9 positions from left to right (or west to east) and 9 positions from bottom to top (or south to north), 81 positions combined. There are eight directions for a foot, pointing north, north west, west, south west, south, south east, east, north east. Or, if you prefer the clock, pointing to 12, 10:30, 9, 7:30, 6, 4:30, 3, 1:30. Or, mathematically speaking and taking 0 degree to point to the right (west), the directions are, in degree, 90 , 135, 180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45. 

In some dances the couple more or less stays on one spot (Salsa, Boogie, Rock 'n' Roll), whereas in others the couple moves along a line and sometimes takes a 90Â° turn (most ballroom dances, Tango Argentino).
For dances on the spot, a fixed window of the dance floor is OK. For the other dances, as the one in the example, we consider the square to be a window sliding over the dance floor as the couple moves along, but the window does not rotate. 

The feet that carry the weight in one pose can't be moved in the next step, so they remain where they are. On the dance floor, that is - since the window slides, the position in the window might change. The foot that gets the weight in the next pose might be at a new position and orientation (or not). What happens between these poses is the motion.  

## Rhythm 

This section is easier to read if you are somewhat familiar with music notation, but I'll try to explain some essentials as I go.  
In the music notation, the note corresponds to the moment when the tone first appears, and the duration of the note signfies how long it can be heard. For the notation of duration of a note, see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_symbols. The event in the dance that corresponds to the onset of the tone is more or less when the weight is put on a foot. The duration of the note corresponds to the duration of the motion between two such events. However, the motion itself is implied like the tone that can be heard for the duration of the note. What is in the notation is the starting pose and the ending pose of one phase of the motion. The duration itself is marked below the square that contains the pose. A line from left to right corresponds to a whole note (see bar 2). The duration of a half note is expressed from left to the middle, a quarter note with a line starting left and going a quarter of the distance to the right end. For shorter durations the line lengths become difficult to distinguish. An eightth therefore is expressed with a short vertical line at the left side, a sixteenth with two vertical lines etc. As in musical notations, dots are used to express for example 3/4. 

## Abstraction

Poses and durations are discretetized. Of course in a real dance the poses and durations vary continuously, and a lot. But the quantization allow the reader to understand the situation at a glance, because the poses can be recognized more easily. We are taken a step from an overly detailed representation to a symbol. This leads to insight into the structure of the dance and of its connection with the music.
