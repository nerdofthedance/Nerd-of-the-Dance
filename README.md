# Dance step notation in a music score


Some dancers including myself would like to have some means to memorize dance steps. 
For me, a notation should be easy to understand, allow for describing the essential structure of a step and for some little extras
and it should be possible to associate the steps with the music. 

Below is an easy example of a notation trying to meet these goals. The step is taken from Tango Argentino and is called base con cruce, a basic step with a cross.

# Requirements

The notation is based on Liypond. Download from http://lilypond.org and install as described there. Lilypond runs on Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, MAC OS X, and Windows. Editing is a lot easier if you also install Frescobaldi, an integrated development environment for Lilypond. Download from http://frescobaldi.org/ and install as described there. It also runs on Linux, MAC OS X and on Windows. 
Other than that there are no requirements.
