# Dance step notation in a music score


Some dancers including myself would like to have some means to memorize dance steps. 
For me, a notation should be easy to understand, allow for describing the essential structure of a step and for some little extras
and it should be possible to associate the steps with the music. 

Below is an easy example of a notation trying to meet these goals. The step is taken from Tango Argentino and is called base con cruce, a basic step with a cross.

The notation is based on Liypond.
